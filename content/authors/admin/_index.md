In the spirit of the philosopher Charles Mills, whose focus was on developing a non-ideal theory to reform and rectify existing and potential injustices, my research program is a computational and empirically driven version of non-ideal philosophy which I coin data-driven non-ideal theory. I use empirical and formal methods to diagnose and remedy various kinds of social inequalities. My dissertation and ongoing research fall into three broad programs: philosophies of social inequality, empirical analysis, and mathematical modeling.
