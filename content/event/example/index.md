abstract: Race is frequently treated as an explanatory variable in causal models throughout the social sciences. Yet, there is lively disagreement about the causal status of race. I defend a position I call causal agnosticism about race, which holds that it is reasonable to withhold judgment as to whether or not race is a cause.
